          # INSTRUCTIONS #

youll be needing a PS4 controller for this

R2= throttle
L2= reverse
Left joystick= steering

square= shift up
X button= shift down
triangle= low beams, high beams toggle
circle= handbrake
dpad up= double press for fog lights
PS button= sport mode and normal mode

when you hold down circle and then hold down fully R2 and set it to the highest gear, when you let go of circle the car launches
in the future im planning on adding a drift function
